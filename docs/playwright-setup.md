# Playwright E2E Testing Setup

When you install dependencies, Playwright browsers will automatically install via the `postinstall` script.

If you need to manually install the browsers:

```bash
npm run playwright:install
```

For troubleshooting on Linux/WSL:

```bash
sudo npx playwright install-deps
```
