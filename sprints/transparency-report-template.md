## Continuous Improvement

### What We Fixed
- **Shadow miscalculation on steep slopes** — Algorithm now compensates for time-of-day
- **API timeout on large batches** — Implemented streaming responses for 50+ properties
- **Slow estimate PDF generation** — Reduced from 8s to 2s average

### What We're Building
- **AutoCAD integration** (Beta: July 2025)
- **Live collaboration mode** for team estimates
- **Offline measurement capability** for field iPads
- **Enhanced hail damage detection** (Target: 95% accuracy)

### Known Limitations
- Tree overhang still requires manual adjustment (fix in progress)
- Multi-building complexes need individual processing
- Historical imagery limited to 2020+ in rural areas
