hidden costs that turn 18% margins into 3% nightmares.

Built by estimators who've been there.
```

**Problem Agitation:**
```
The 2 AM Questions That Cost Money

"Did I account for all the deck repairs?"
"What if there's moisture we can't see?"  
"Is my contingency enough for this jurisdiction?"
"Am I missing something obvious?"

These aren't anxiety—they're expensive when wrong.
```

one missed detail becomes everyone's emergency.

manufacturer requirements, and compatibility matrices—before the RFI storm.
```

**Problem Agitation:**
```
The Specification Landmines

"Is this detail still compliant with updated codes?"
"Will these components actually work together?"
"Did I specify the right fastener pattern for this wind zone?"
"Am I creating a maintenance nightmare?"

Every RFI is time you don't have.
```

### Building Owner Landing Page

**Above the Fold:**
```
You're comparing quotes that range from $200K to $380K
for the "same" project. The difference isn't markup—
