## Infrastructure & Architecture Security

### Q: Describe your infrastructure architecture and hosting environment.

**MyRoofGenius Response:**

We operate a multi-tenant SaaS architecture hosted on AWS with geographic distribution across multiple availability zones. Our infrastructure implements:

- **Compute**: Auto-scaling EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers
- **Storage**: S3 with server-side encryption, versioning, and lifecycle policies
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL with automated backups and point-in-time recovery
- **Network**: VPC with private subnets, NAT gateways, and AWS WAF protection

All infrastructure is defined as code using Terraform, enabling consistent deployment and disaster recovery. We maintain complete network isolation between customer environments through tenant-specific database schemas and row-level security policies.

**Evidence**: AWS Well-Architected Review passed May 2025

### Q: How do you ensure data isolation in a multi-tenant environment?

**MyRoofGenius Response:**

Data isolation is enforced at multiple layers:

1. **Database Level**: Every table includes a `tenant_id` discriminator column with row-level security policies preventing cross-tenant queries
2. **Application Level**: All queries are automatically scoped to the authenticated tenant via middleware injection
3. **API Level**: JWT tokens include tenant claims validated on every request
4. **Storage Level**: Tenant-specific S3 bucket prefixes with IAM policies restricting access

We perform quarterly penetration testing specifically targeting tenant isolation controls. Attempting to access another tenant's data results in immediate request termination and security alerting.

**Evidence**: Zero cross-tenant vulnerabilities in last 3 penetration tests

## Access Control & Authentication

### Q: What authentication methods do you support?

**MyRoofGenius Response:**

MyRoofGenius implements defense-in-depth authentication:

- **Primary**: Username/password with complexity requirements (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- **MFA**: Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) via authenticator apps
- **SSO**: SAML 2.0 integration for enterprise customers (Okta, Azure AD, Auth0)
- **API**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens and configurable expiration
- **Session Management**: 30-minute idle timeout with secure cookie flags

Password storage uses bcrypt with cost factor 12, and we enforce password history to prevent reuse of last 12 passwords.

**Evidence**: OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet compliance verified

### Q: How do you manage privileged access?

**MyRoofGenius Response:**

Privileged access follows principle of least privilege:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 5 standard roles with customizable permissions
- **Just-In-Time Access**: Temporary elevation for support issues (max 4 hours)
- **Approval Workflow**: Manager approval required for privilege changes
- **Audit Trail**: All privileged actions logged with actor, timestamp, and justification
- **Segregation of Duties**: Production access requires separate approval from code deployment

Administrative access requires MFA and VPN connection from approved IP ranges. We review all privileged access quarterly and immediately revoke upon role change.

**Evidence**: SOC 2 Type I certification achieved for access controls

## Data Protection & Encryption

### Q: How is data encrypted at rest and in transit?

**MyRoofGenius Response:**

Comprehensive encryption protects data throughout its lifecycle:

**At Rest:**
- Database: AES-256 encryption using AWS RDS encryption
- File Storage: S3 server-side encryption with customer-managed KMS keys
- Backups: Separate encryption keys rotated every 90 days
- Local Storage: No sensitive data stored in browser localStorage

**In Transit:**
- TLS 1.3 minimum for all client connections
- Certificate pinning for mobile applications
- Perfect Forward Secrecy enabled
- HSTS headers with 1-year max-age

**Key Management:**
- AWS KMS for key generation and rotation
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) backing
- Automated key rotation every 90 days
- Split knowledge and dual control for master keys

**Evidence**: Annual encryption audit by independent third party

### Q: Do you encrypt sensitive fields at the field level?

**MyRoofGenius Response:**

Yes, we implement field-level encryption for highly sensitive data:

- **PII Fields**: SSN, driver's license, bank account numbers use format-preserving encryption
- **API Keys**: Stored using one-way hashing with per-key salts
- **Payment Data**: Tokenized via PCI-compliant payment processor (we never store)
- **Credentials**: External system passwords encrypted with tenant-specific keys

Field-level encryption uses authenticated encryption (AES-GCM) to prevent tampering. Decryption requires both application-layer permissions and key access.

**Evidence**: PCI DSS SAQ-A compliance maintained

### Q: How do you handle data subject rights requests?

**MyRoofGenius Response:**

Automated workflows handle privacy rights:

**GDPR Rights:**
- Access requests: Automated export within 30 days via `/privacy/export` API
- Deletion requests: 7-day grace period, then automated purge via `/privacy/delete`
- Portability: JSON export format with documented schema
