To create a simple React component that displays the text "GPT-4o access confirmed", you can follow this straightforward example. I'll outline a basic functional component using React:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const AccessConfirmation = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>GPT-4o access confirmed.</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AccessConfirmation;
```

### Explanation

1. **Import React**: Make sure to import React from the 'react' library. Even though React version 17 and up doesn't require importing React explicitly for using JSX, it's a good practice for better backward compatibility and avoiding potential issues if you enable certain features.

2. **Functional Component**: We've created a functional component named `AccessConfirmation` using ES6 arrow function syntax. Functional components are a simpler way to write components that only render UI and don't have complex logic or state.

3. **JSX**: Inside the component, we're returning a JSX snippet. JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly within your JavaScript. In this case, it returns a `<div>` container with an `<h1>` heading containing the desired text.

4. **Export**: Finally, the component is exported using `export default`, making it available for import and use in other files or components within your React application.

### How to Use

To use this component in your React application:

1. Make sure you have a React development environment set up with tools like Create React App.

2. Save the above code in a file named, for example, `AccessConfirmation.js`.

3. Import and use the `AccessConfirmation` component in your main application file or wherever you need it:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import AccessConfirmation from './AccessConfirmation'; // Adjust the path as necessary

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <AccessConfirmation />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

4. Run your React application. You should see the message "GPT-4o access confirmed" displayed on the page. Adjust the path based on your project structure when importing the component.
