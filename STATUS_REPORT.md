## Immediate Action Items
1. Create missing base files and stubs for dashboard, webhook, success page
2. Implement Supabase auth helpers and server client
3. Add Stripe webhook handling logic
4. Fix UI component TypeScript definitions
5. Confirm AI model configuration

## Recommended Execution Order
1. Establish core auth infrastructure (supabase-server.ts, auth-helpers.ts)
2. Implement Stripe webhook route and success page
3. Resolve TypeScript issues in UI components
4. Continue remaining sprints sequentially once baseline builds
