# Security Implementation Checklist

## Why This Matters

If you're configuring MyRoofGenius for your organization, every security decision cascades through thousands of measurements, estimates, and contracts. This checklist ensures your implementation protects data at rest, in transit, and during every calculation — without adding friction to daily operations.

## What This Protects

- **Customer trust** through verifiable tenant isolation
- **Competitive data** with role-based access controls
- **Compliance posture** via automatic audit trails
- **Operational continuity** with zero-trust verification

## Pre-Implementation Requirements

Before starting, verify you have:
- [ ] Administrator access to MyRoofGenius
- [ ] List of all users and their job functions
- [ ] Understanding of your data classification requirements
- [ ] Compliance obligations (GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2)

## Phase 1: Tenant Isolation Verification

### 1.1 Confirm Tenant Boundaries

- [ ] Log in as admin and navigate to **Settings → Security → Tenant Configuration**
- [ ] Verify your `tenant_id` appears in the URL: `/tenant/{your_id}/settings`
- [ ] Confirm tenant name and identifier match your organization

### 1.2 Test Data Isolation

- [ ] Create a test project in your tenant
- [ ] Attempt to access via direct URL from another user account
- [ ] **Expected result**: 403 Forbidden with no data leakage
- [ ] Document test results in your security log

### 1.3 Verify Database Partitioning

- [ ] Request tenant isolation report from **Support → Security Reports**
- [ ] Confirm all tables show `tenant_id` enforcement
- [ ] Validate backup segregation is active
- [ ] **Critical**: No shared resources should appear

## Phase 2: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### 2.1 Define Role Structure

Map your organization's job functions to MyRoofGenius roles:

| Job Function | Recommended Role | Key Permissions |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Estimator | `estimate:creator` | Create/edit estimates, view measurements |
| Reviewer | `estimate:approver` | All estimator permissions + approve/reject |
| Admin | `org:admin` | All permissions + user management |
| Viewer | `read:only` | View all, edit nothing |
| API System | `api:integration` | Scoped to specific resources |

### 2.2 Implement Least Privilege

For each user:
- [ ] Assign minimum role needed for job function
- [ ] Remove default permissions if not required
- [ ] Document role assignment rationale
- [ ] Set up quarterly access reviews

### 2.3 Configure Permission Boundaries

- [ ] Navigate to **Settings → Roles → Custom Permissions**
- [ ] For each custom role, explicitly define:
  - [ ] Resource access (projects, estimates, measurements)
  - [ ] Action permissions (create, read, update, delete)
  - [ ] Data export capabilities
  - [ ] API access scopes

## Phase 3: Authentication & Session Management

### 3.1 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

- [ ] Enable MFA requirement: **Settings → Security → Authentication**
- [ ] Set enforcement level:
  - [ ] Mandatory for admins
  - [ ] Mandatory for API access
  - [ ] Optional (but encouraged) for standard users
- [ ] Configure backup codes policy

### 3.2 Session Security

- [ ] Set session timeout: 30 minutes inactive (configurable)
- [ ] Enable concurrent session limits: Max 3 per user
- [ ] Configure IP allowlisting for sensitive roles
- [ ] Implement device trust for known workstations

### 3.3 Password Policy

- [ ] Minimum 12 characters
- [ ] Require complexity (upper, lower, number, special)
- [ ] Prevent last 12 password reuse
- [ ] Force change every 90 days for privileged accounts

## Phase 4: API & Integration Security

### 4.1 API Key Management

- [ ] Generate unique API keys per integration
- [ ] Apply principle of least scope:
  ```
  Scope examples:
  - CRM sync: read:contacts, write:estimates
  - Reporting tool: read:all, no write permissions
  - Mobile app: full access with device binding
  ```
- [ ] Set key expiration: 365 days maximum
- [ ] Enable key rotation reminders: 30 days before expiry

### 4.2 Webhook Security

- [ ] Configure webhook URLs with HTTPS only
- [ ] Generate unique signing secrets per endpoint
- [ ] Enable webhook retry logic with backoff
- [ ] Monitor failed webhook attempts

## Phase 5: Audit & Compliance

### 5.1 Audit Log Configuration

- [ ] Verify audit logging captures:
  - [ ] All authentication attempts
  - [ ] Permission changes
  - [ ] Data exports
  - [ ] Estimate approvals/rejections
  - [ ] API usage
- [ ] Set audit retention: 7 years (or per compliance requirement)
- [ ] Configure audit log immutability

### 5.2 Compliance Reporting

- [ ] Schedule monthly security reports
- [ ] Configure alerts for:
  - [ ] Failed login attempts (>5 in 10 minutes)
  - [ ] Privilege escalation
  - [ ] Mass data exports
  - [ ] Cross-tenant access attempts
- [ ] Assign security report reviewers

## Phase 6: Data Protection

### 6.1 Encryption Verification

- [ ] Confirm TLS 1.3 for all connections
- [ ] Verify AES-256 encryption at rest
- [ ] Check field-level encryption for PII
- [ ] Validate key rotation schedule (90 days)

### 6.2 Data Classification

- [ ] Tag sensitive fields:
  - [ ] Customer names/addresses: PII
  - [ ] Pricing/margins: Confidential
  - [ ] Measurements: Proprietary
  - [ ] System credentials: Secret

### 6.3 Backup Security

- [ ] Verify backups are tenant-isolated
- [ ] Confirm backup encryption with separate keys
- [ ] Test restore process to isolated environment
- [ ] Document backup access procedures

## Phase 7: Incident Response Preparation

### 7.1 Response Team

- [ ] Designate security incident commander
- [ ] Create escalation matrix with contact info
- [ ] Establish 15-minute response SLA
- [ ] Document communication channels

### 7.2 Playbook Creation

Create runbooks for:
- [ ] Suspected data breach
- [ ] Account compromise
- [ ] API abuse
- [ ] Tenant boundary violation

## Validation Checklist

Before going live, verify:

- [ ] All users have appropriate roles assigned
- [ ] MFA is active for privileged accounts
- [ ] API keys follow least-privilege model
- [ ] Audit logs are capturing all critical events
- [ ] Incident response team is trained
- [ ] Security documentation is complete
- [ ] Quarterly review schedule is set

## What to Watch For

**Red flags requiring immediate action:**
- Login attempts from unexpected locations
- Bulk data exports by non-admin users
- API usage spikes outside business hours
- Failed tenant isolation tests

**Monthly review items:**
- User access appropriateness
- API key usage patterns
- Audit log anomalies
- Security alert trends

## Next Steps

1. Schedule quarterly security reviews
2. Subscribe to security advisory notifications
3. Join the Security Champions program for advanced training
4. Configure automated compliance reporting
