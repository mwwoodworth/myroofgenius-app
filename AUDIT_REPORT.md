# Audit Report

## Overview
This audit reviewed the Next.js codebase focusing on component quality, TypeScript strictness, accessibility, and tests. Several issues were found and fixed.

## Issues Fixed

- **Duplicate components folder** – `PageTransitionWrapper` was stored in `components/components`. File moved to `components/` and import path validated.
- **Unnecessary `any` types and unused params** – Replaced `any` in `GalaxyCanvas`, `Uploader`, `AdminDashboard`, and `ClientLayout` with explicit types.
- **Broken tests** – Page transition wrapper used `useRouter` causing errors when rendered in tests. Switched to `usePathname`.
- **Accessibility** – Added required `alt` prop to `RemoteModelViewer` and `LazyImage`. Removed invalid `aria-invalid` from radio inputs.
- **TypeScript strictness** – Added interface `CopilotLog` and `BeforeInstallPromptEvent`. Updated refs with correct generics.

## Remaining Warnings

- None after linting and tests.

## Testing

- `npm run lint` – passed with no warnings.
- `npm test` – all tests pass.
